# Chang Task Management Application

Chang (th. ช้าง, english elephant) is a task management application.  The goal
of this project was to be as vanilla as possible, using just builtin python
libraries for development and production. Under the hood Chang uses a sqlite database.
Chang comes with a costom object-relational mapper for communication with the database,
a http server for viewing the task lists in a browser like chrome, a cli for working
with the terminal and (an own templating engine)
